# Hello-World-
First try one Github. 


Hello there, I'm Allen. I love jogging, reading, learning, and of course, programming.

    At first, I knew nothing about GitHub. Thanksfully, the site provides informative gudeline as to the basic operation
    (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

    After that, I learned that GitHub is a hosting platform for version contral and collaboration. Along the tutorial, I
    first create a new "hello world" in C++. Then, I added some profile of myself into README.md, which was made in temporary 
    branch called "readme-edit."
    
    The rest is to commits my changes on readme then pull resquests for someone to examine and merge into the master branch. In this case-me. 
    
    That's how I first use GitHub, and I can't wait to do more things with it~
